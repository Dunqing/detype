# detype

> Remove types, keep formatting

**detype** is a command line tool to remove type annotations and other TypeScript specific syntax constructs and output vanilla JavaScript **without altering the source formatting** too much.

One possible use case is generating vanilla JavaScript code samples from TypeScript, removing the need to maintain two separate versions of what is essentially the same code.
